# Sergio's DWL

My own patches for DWL, the Suckless dynamic window manager for Wayland!

## Purpose

My goal here is to replicate what I already did in my DWM fork but in DWL. It should not be that difficult should it?

Well, the thing is that my DWM fork was poorly done, so instead of keeping all modifications on patches I went and edited them in the main tree, so I have to go and check whatever I did in the past manually and then port it here, whenever possible.

In this repo I will only post patches and keep DWL as a submodule, which should make updating and keeping track of my work much easier.

## Building

DWL can be built with the following command:

```sh
make
```
